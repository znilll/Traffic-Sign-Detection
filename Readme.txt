CNN_Model folder is where we saved our trained cnn model

code_files have 3 scripts
	cnn_classifier is where we train, test and save our cnn classifier model

	yolov4_image_detector is where we used a pretrained yolov4 model for detecting 	traffic signs from images
	
	yolov4_video_detector is where we used a pretrained yolov4 model for detecting 	traffic signs from videos


results folder is where our image and video outputs are saved

Make sure that the working directory is code_files before running scripts

there is no data and yolov4 folder for now. They will be added
