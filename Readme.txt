CNN_Model folder is where we saved our trained cnn model

code_files have 3 scripts
	cnn_classifier is where we train, test and save our cnn classifier model

	yolov4_image_detector is where we used a pretrained yolov4 model for detecting 	traffic signs from images
	
	yolov4_video_detector is where we used a pretrained yolov4 model for detecting 	traffic signs from videos

data folder has input images and one input video, train test and validation datasets

results folder is where our image and video outputs are saved

yolov4 folder has the weights and conf files of pretrained yolov4 model

Make sure that the working directory is code_files before running scripts
